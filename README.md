# 4x-Exploration

Creating a basic 4X game using hexes

/// Goals ///
In Progress:
1. Create an interactable hex map with world wrapping and different terrain types

To Do:
2. Add turn based mechanics
3. Add units that can move through the map interacting with each other and the world
4. Add cityies and improvement management
5. Add AI characters with chat (using ink?)
6. Add syncronous turn multiplayer

// the hope here is to create a basic framework for building a larger 4x game
