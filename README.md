# 4x-Exploration
unity version: 2020.2.6f1

Creating a basic 4X game using hexes

/// Goals ///
In Progress:
1. Create an interactable hex map with world wrapping and different terrain types
	- Lookup project porcupine for example to help migrating the terrain definitions to a config file (JSON?) & map generation to LUA

To Do:
2. Add turn based mechanics
3. Add units that can move through the map interacting with each other and the world
4. Add cities and improvements, and the ability to manage these
5. Add AI characters with chat (using ink?)
6. Add syncronous turn multiplayer

// the hope here is to create a basic framework for building a larger 4x game
